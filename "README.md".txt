"Pain Descriptor Explorer" (NLP + Python Tool)
Goal:
Build an interactive Python-based tool (CLI or web-based) that analyzes, categorizes, and visualizes pain descriptors from your dataset. It could help explore patterns in how pain is described linguistically — and could evolve into something useful for researchers or clinicians.

A tool that acknowledges that descriptors can be multi-layered — and you're capturing both their experiential (sensory/affective) and figurative (metaphorical/submetaphorical) dimensions.
